How would you set up the companyâ€™s cloud account to run pipelines securely and robustly?

Answers:

Create a different account for a different purpose. 
Separation of duty:

Create or use the default AWS identity policy to control the pipeline credentials that only have limited access, (R, W or execute). 
For example: AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

Create the resource policy to control the IAM account can access the type of resource. Example: the pipeline needs to access the S3 resource by using the account that only allows to access S3 only.
